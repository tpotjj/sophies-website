# Sophie's first website
## and maybe her last

Every Thursday, my beautiful girlfriend and I do a date night. It's a non negotiable event that happens on a weekly basis, and it ranges from going outdoors and try something new, to a boardgames night, fighting over who won (or lost).

As of January 1st, she started a new job as a Customer Success manager for a Software company, and every night she comes home full of new things she learned; CDKs, SDKs, APIs and whatsoever.

So why not spend a date night, teaching her some of the basic Web development skills that might come in handy in the future.

The following topics will be covered in different tutorials
- [Chapter 1: HTML](tutorials/chapter-1)
- [Chapter 2: CSS](tutorials/chapter-2)
- [Chapter 3: JavaScript](tutorials/chapter-3)
